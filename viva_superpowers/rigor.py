"""Evidence & rigor scorecard — deterministic feedback on how well a study /
investigation defends its claims against a skeptical reader.

Motivation
----------
A skeptical reviewer of a simulation-based investigation repeatedly asks the
same questions: *Did you replicate across seeds? Where are the negative
controls? Have you separated observation from interpretation and excluded
alternative explanations? Are the acceptance criteria falsifiable, or tailored
to succeed? Is there an adversarial study that tries to break the framework?*

The framework already has rich structure (behavior_tests, gates, findings,
acceptance_criteria, simulation_set.seeds) but never *computes feedback* on
these dimensions, so authors omit them and reviewers can't see the gaps. This
module turns each rigor dimension into a deterministic signal computed from
declared (optional) fields. A missing field is not an error — it produces a
``gap`` signal, which IS the feedback that prompts the next investigation to do
better.

Everything here is pure and deterministic (no LLM/AI) so the AI-free dashboard
can call it directly. Mirrors :mod:`viva_superpowers.study_verdict` in spirit:
pure ``spec -> dict`` functions.
