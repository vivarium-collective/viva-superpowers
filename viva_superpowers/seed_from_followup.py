"""Pass 10B helper for ``/viva-study seed-from-followup --from-finding <id>``.

The bulk of ``seed-from-followup`` is prose-driven (the Claude host
follows the steps in ``skills/viva-study/SKILL.md``) — there is no
dashboard API and no full Python implementation. What *can* be made
deterministic and testable is the **finding-to-child pre-population**:
given a parent study and a finding id, derive the child's ``purpose``
block, ``key_assumptions``, ``seeded_from`` stamp, plus a starter
``pipeline_gate``, ``behavior_tests`` carryover, and a ``model_change``
hint, and produce the updated parent proposal entry. This module
exposes those primitives so the prose flow + a CLI smoke test can
share one implementation.

Public surface:

  - :func:`build_child_seed_from_finding` — pure function: given the
    parent study dict, a proposal id, and a finding id, returns a
    ``ChildSeed`` with the new study's ``purpose`` + ``key_assumptions``
    + ``seeded_from`` + ``pipeline_gate`` + ``behavior_tests`` +
    ``model_change`` ready to merge into the child template.
  - :func:`build_parent_proposal_patch` — pure function: returns the
    updated proposal-entry dict (status flipped to ``seeded``,
    ``seeded_study`` set, ``linked_finding`` added if absent).
  - :func:`apply_from_finding` — convenience wrapper that loads the
    parent yaml, builds both diffs, and returns them; the actual
    file writes still live in the prose flow (mirrors the
    propose-followup pattern).

Findings-to-child heuristic (also documented in SKILL.md so the
prose flow stays in sync):

  - ``purpose.question`` ← derived from the finding's ``next_action``
    (e.g. "Investigate why X" / "Calibrate Y to match Z"). Falls back
    to "Investigate <finding.statement first-sentence>?" if absent.
  - ``purpose.mechanism`` ← finding's ``explanation`` verbatim (when
    set; else empty string).
  - ``purpose.expected_outcome`` ← derived from ``next_action`` if it
    implies a target (heuristic: keywords like "to match", "within",
    "in range"); else empty string.
  - ``key_assumptions[0]`` ← ``evidence.smoking_gun`` (if present and
    a plain string).
  - ``seeded_from.finding`` ← the supplied finding id.
  - ``seeded_from.evidence`` ← copy of the parent finding's
    ``evidence`` block, so the child's lineage is self-contained
    without the reader having to flip back to the parent.
  - ``pipeline_gate.proceed_condition`` ← finding's ``next_action``
    verbatim, as a starting point for what unblocks downstream work.
  - ``behavior_tests`` ← the parent's behavior_test referenced by
    ``finding.evidence.from_test`` (the test that produced this
    finding — exactly what the follow-up must make pass), reclassified
    as ``primary``.
  - ``model_change`` ← ``{notes: "TBD — see purpose.mechanism for
    the hypothesized mechanism."}`` when the finding has an
    ``explanation`` to anchor on; absent otherwise.

The host Claude can edit any of these before writing — this just
seeds the draft.
