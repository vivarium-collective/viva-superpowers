"""Roll per-test outcomes → a study verdict → write the coded gate_evaluator slot.

Spine stage #2 (coded gate/verdict/acceptance roll-up).

The verdict rule is the single canonical source replacing the three inline
``tests-passed`` re-implementations. The ``passed`` predicate EXACTLY matches
``vivarium_workbench.lib.investigations_index._condition_satisfied`` ``tests-passed`` branch:
    counts["fail"] == 0 and counts["pass"] > 0

Public API
----------
roll_up_verdict(spec) -> dict
    Pure function: canonical per-test outcomes → {result, blocked_by, evaluated_by}.

write_gate_evaluator(study_dir) -> bool
    Ruamel round-trip write of pipeline_gate.gate_evaluator (parallel coded slot).
    Never touches gate_status / report.verdict / any authored field.
    Returns True when the file was changed, False on a no-op (idempotent).

      (``tier`` of mechanism/interpretation), not a bare observation.
    - ``tested-vs-alternatives`` — a competing explanation has been EXCLUDED and
      its discriminator names this finding's test (reuses the rigor alternatives
      matcher; degrades to "any excluded alternative in the study").

      #22; reuses ``rigor._has_generality_signal``).

    level is returned (the floor). An authored ``lifecycle_state`` may sit ABOVE
    the floor, but the linter warns when it sits BELOW. ``retired`` /
    ``superseded`` are never returned (they are author-only terminal states).
