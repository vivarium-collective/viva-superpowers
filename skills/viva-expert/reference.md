# viva-expert — detailed reference

Companion reference for **SKILL.md** in this skill directory. SKILL.md holds
the doctrine, mode detection, safety rules, and the API/port/composite-assembly
principles an agent needs to make decisions; this file holds the long
procedural walkthroughs, file/code templates, and per-mode step-by-steps.
Section headings not defined in this file (Port Design, Bridge Pattern,
Auto-Discovery Convention, Composite Assembly, Emitters, Process-Bigraph API
Essentials, Bigraph-Schema Essentials, Mode Detection, Non-Negotiable Safety
Rules) live in SKILL.md.

## Initial Repo Setup

Derive a clean lowercase hyphenated `TOOL_NAME` from `$ARGUMENTS`, then create a fresh repo.

```bash
TOOL_NAME="<tool>"
WORKSPACE="${VIVA_WORKSPACE:-$HOME/code}"
REPO_DIR="${WORKSPACE}/viva-${TOOL_NAME}"

if [ -d "$REPO_DIR" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: $REPO_DIR already exists."
    exit 1
fi

mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE"

mkdir -p "$REPO_DIR"
cd "$REPO_DIR"
git init

uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install process-bigraph bigraph-schema bigraph-viz pytest matplotlib plotly
```

Immediately write `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/
*.pyc
.pytest_cache/
output/
*.nc
.idea/
```

All subsequent work must happen inside the new repo.

### Conda-only tools: use pixi instead of uv

Some simulators are conda-only — no usable PyPI wheel, or the real
dependency graph (native solvers, MPI, mesh libraries) only resolves
cleanly through `conda-forge` (e.g. FEniCS/dolfinx, CompuCell3D). For
these, skip the `uv venv` step above entirely and manage the environment
with **pixi** instead: one `pixi.toml` on the `conda-forge` channel holding
**both** the simulator (via `[dependencies]`, conda packages) **and** the
pbg/dashboard stack (via `[pypi-dependencies]`: `process-bigraph`,
`bigraph-schema`, `vivarium-workbench`, `pbg-superpowers`, plus this
wrapper's own package as an editable path dependency). Every command in
this skill (`pytest`, the study runners, `vivarium-workbench-publish`,
`scripts/lint-workspace.py`) then runs via `pixi run <cmd>` instead of
`source .venv/bin/activate && <cmd>`.

Precedents: `viva-fenics` (dolfinx + gmsh + mpich alongside the full pbg
stack in one pixi env) and `pbg-compucell3d` (cc3d from its own conda
channel). Minimal `pixi.toml` shape (adapt channels/deps per tool):

```toml
[workspace]
name = "viva-<tool>"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["osx-arm64"]   # add linux-64 / others as needed
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
python = "3.12.*"
pip = "*"
# <tool>'s native/conda deps here, e.g.:
# fenics-dolfinx = "*"
# mpich = "*"

[pypi-dependencies]
process-bigraph = { git = "https://github.com/vivarium-collective/process-bigraph.git", branch = "main" }
bigraph-schema = "*"
bigraph-viz2 = "*"
vivarium-workbench = { git = "https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-workbench.git", branch = "main" }
pbg-superpowers = "*"    # dist name intentionally still "pbg-superpowers" post-rebrand (PyPI)
plotly = "*"
pytest = "*"
viva-<tool> = { path = ".", editable = true }
```

Run `pixi install` once to solve + build the env (writes `pixi.lock`,
commit it). From then on every invocation elsewhere in this skill that
says `source .venv/bin/activate && <cmd>` becomes `pixi run <cmd>` for a
pixi-managed repo. This changes **only** how commands are invoked — the
repo/workspace layout, deliverables, and Phase-by-phase workflow below are
identical between the uv and pixi paths. The default for pip-installable
tools remains the uv `.venv` path above; reach for pixi only when the
simulator itself needs conda.

**CI for a pixi workspace.** The workspace scaffolder ships a `uv`/`pip`-based
`.github/workflows/workspace-ci.yml` (plus legacy `publish-reports.yml` and a
`build-and-push.yml` Docker job). For a conda-only tool these are **guaranteed
red** — `pytest` will `import <tool>` and fail because the conda simulator was
never pip-installed. Before pushing, make the workflows conda-aware:

- **Add the CI platform to `pixi.toml`.** GitHub runners are Linux, so the
  osx-only default won't solve there: `platforms = ["osx-arm64", "linux-64"]`,
  then `pixi lock` (re-locks for both) and commit `pixi.lock`.
- **Convert `workspace-ci.yml` to pixi** — `uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1`
  (pin a version, `cache: true`), then `pixi run python scripts/lint-workspace.py`
  and `pixi run pytest -q`. Keep the `check-no-local-paths.sh` step. Real dolfinx
  is present via the conda env, so tests run for real (not skipped).
- **Commit the vendored `.pbg/schemas/`.** `scripts/lint-workspace.py` validates
  `workspace.yaml`/`study.yaml` against `.pbg/schemas/*.json` with no package
  fallback, so a fresh CI checkout needs them tracked. `.pbg/` is otherwise
  runtime state — use a **granular** ignore (`\.pbg/*` + `!\.pbg/schemas/`), never
  a blanket `.pbg/` (a blanket line overrides the re-include and the lint step
  fails on CI with "missing schema … was workspace scaffolded?"). `git add
  .pbg/schemas/`.
- **Convert `publish-dashboard.yml`** to build under pixi too
  (`pixi run bash scripts/publish_dashboard.sh reports/published/dashboard`) so
  the static export has the simulator available for composite discovery.
- **Delete the workflows that don't apply**: legacy `publish-reports.yml` (the
  read-only workbench supersedes the client-side HTML-report flow) and
  `build-and-push.yml` (GHCR Docker image — not part of this deliverable).

Precedent: `viva-fenics`'s `.github/workflows/` (pixi `workspace-ci.yml` +
`publish-dashboard.yml`, no report/docker jobs).

One consequence of pixi/uv-build editable installs: they are **not**
auto-discovered by `allocate_core()` the way a standard `pip install -e .`
is (see **Auto-Discovery Convention** below for why, and the required
`build_core()` workaround).

## Deliverables

Every `viva-<tool>` repo this skill produces is **also a discoverable
pbg-workspace** (`workspace.yaml` at root, registered in
`~/.pbg/workspaces.json`, scanned by the dashboard's Composites tab via
`@composite_generator` decorators). Heavy-mode is workspace-first; the
package, showcase investigation, and tests all live inside that workspace
shape.

Final layout after Phase 5 (showcase investigation + publish):

The completed repo must include:

1. A wrapped process-bigraph `Step` or `Process`
2. Appropriate bigraph-schema port and config schemas
3. Custom type registration if needed
4. Unit and integration tests (including one that asserts the generator
   is in `process_bigraph.composite_generator._REGISTRY`)
5. Offline-safe fixtures or examples
6. **One or more `@composite_generator`-decorated functions** in
   `viva_<tool>/composites/` — these are the dashboard-visible entry points
7. A README with installation, quick start, API reference, architecture,
   and a link to the published dashboard
8. **One showcase investigation** (`investigations/<tool>-showcase/`) binding
   studies with committed interactive viz, runs recorded in
   `.pbg/runs.jsonl`, and a published read-only workbench bundle
   (`reports/published/dashboard/`) via `scripts/publish_dashboard.sh` +
   `.github/workflows/publish-dashboard.yml`
9. A `workspace.yaml` and registration in `~/.pbg/workspaces.json`
10. A local git commit

## Workflow: detailed phase-by-phase (Phases 3-5)

See SKILL.md's `## Workflow` for Phase 1 and Phase 2 and the one/two-line overview of Phases 3-5. This section is the deep walkthrough for Phase 3 onward.

### Phase 3: Implement

Implement:

- `viva_<tool>/processes.py`
- `viva_<tool>/types.py`
- `viva_<tool>/composites/__init__.py` + `viva_<tool>/composites/<topic>.py`
  (one or more `@composite_generator`-decorated functions — see
  **Composite Assembly → Ship composite generators**)
- package exports in `__init__.py` (re-export Process classes AND the
  decorated generators by name)
- `pyproject.toml`

**`pyproject.toml` template** — always include `bigraph-schema` and
`process-bigraph` in `dependencies` so the package is auto-discoverable.
Follow the full PyPI-ready convention from
[docs/conventions/distribution.md](../../docs/conventions/distribution.md):

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=1.18"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "viva-<tool>"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Process-bigraph wrapper for <Tool>"
readme = "README.md"
license = {text = "MIT"}
requires-python = ">=3.10"
authors = [{name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com"}]
classifiers = [
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics",
]
dependencies = [
    "bigraph-schema>=0.0.60",
    "process-bigraph>=0.0.66",
    # add the wrapped tool here, e.g.:
    # "cobra>=0.29",
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/vivarium-collective/viva-<tool>"
Issues = "https://github.com/vivarium-collective/viva-<tool>/issues"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["viva_<tool>"]
```

**PyPI trusted publishing setup is required before the first release.**
See https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/ for the one-time PyPI + GitHub
configuration. Once set up, pushing a `v*` tag triggers the release workflow.

**`viva_<tool>/processes.py` template** — process classes must inherit from
`process_bigraph.Process` (or `Step`) so discovery can find them:

```python
"""<ToolName> process-bigraph wrapper."""

from process_bigraph import Process


class <ToolName>Process(Process):
    """Time-stepped wrapper for <ToolName>.

    Inputs
    ------
    <input_port> : float
        <description>

    Outputs
    -------
    <output_port> : float
        Delta emitted per interval; accumulates additively with sibling processes.
    """

    config_schema = {
        "rate": {"_type": "float", "_default": 0.1},
    }

    def inputs(self):
        return {"<input_port>": "float"}

    def outputs(self):
        return {"<output_port>": "float"}

    def initial_state(self):
        return {"<input_port>": 0.0}

    def update(self, state, interval):
        return {"<output_port>": state["<input_port>"] * self.config["rate"] * interval}
```

**`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — create this file to enable automated
PyPI publishing on version tags. See
[docs/conventions/distribution.md](../../docs/conventions/distribution.md)
for the complete workflow and trusted-publisher setup instructions:

```yaml
name: release
on:
  push:
    tags: ["v*"]
permissions:
  id-token: write   # for PyPI trusted publishing
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: {python-version: "3.11"}
      - name: Install uv
        run: pip install uv
      - name: Build
        run: uv build
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

Add `.github/workflows/release.yml` to the deliverables directory structure
and to `git add` during the final commit.

**`viva_<tool>/__init__.py` template** — import and re-export all process
classes via `__all__` so discovery and users see a clean surface:

```python
"""viva-<tool>: process-bigraph wrapper for <ToolName>."""

from .processes import <ToolName>Process

__all__ = ["<ToolName>Process"]
```

Use full type annotations where practical.

### Phase 4: Test

Write tests for:

- Process or Step instantiation
- Single `update()` call
- Composite assembly
- Short simulation run
- Serialization or round-trip behavior where relevant
- Edge cases
- Offline operation

Example:

```python
def test_my_process_update():
    # If the package is pip-installed, allocate_core() registers it
    # automatically via bigraph_schema.package.discover — no register_link needed.
    # For classes defined inline in test files (not pip-installed), use
    # core.register_link() only in that narrow case.
    core = allocate_core()

    proc = MyProcess(config={"rate": 0.5}, core=core)
    result = proc.update({"level": 10.0}, interval=1.0)

    assert abs(result["level"] - 5.0) < 1e-6
```

Run tests from the repo venv:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

Fix all failures before committing.

Add at least one test that asserts the composite generator is in the
shared registry (cheap protection against forgetting the side-effect
import in `composites/__init__.py`):

```python
def test_generator_is_registered():
    from process_bigraph.composite_generator import _REGISTRY
    matches = [eid for eid in _REGISTRY if eid.endswith(".<tool>_baseline")]
    assert matches, f"<tool>_baseline missing; have {list(_REGISTRY)[:5]}"
```

### Phase 4.5: Promote to a discoverable pbg-workspace

After processes, generators, and tests are in place, run the
in-place workspace scaffolder so the repo also appears in the
vivarium-workbench's workspace switcher and Composites tab. This is
**not optional** — viva-* repos are workspace-shaped by convention.

```bash
# Scaffold in place. Default would create a `<repo>-workspace` branch; for a
# fresh single-developer wrapper, stay on main by passing --branch main.
vwb scaffold-workspace \
    --in-place \
    --name <tool> \
    --target . \
    --package viva_<tool> \
    --branch main

# Register the new workspace so the dashboard's switcher sees it.
vwb catalog-add \
    --path "$(pwd)" --name <tool> --package viva_<tool>

# Sanity-check the resulting layout.
python scripts/lint-workspace.py    # prints "workspace lint: OK"
```

The scaffolder will:

- Drop `workspace.yaml` at the repo root (schema_version 2).
- Add top-level `references/`, `reports/`, `scripts/`,
  `docs/`, `notes/`, `datasets/`.
- Merge dashboard deps (`pyyaml`, `jsonschema`, `jinja2`, `vivarium-workbench`)
  into the existing `pyproject.toml`.
- Append `.pbg/` runtime paths to `.gitignore`.
- Create a single bootstrap commit on the chosen branch.

If a previous run already promoted the repo, `--in-place` refuses to
re-overlay — that's intentional. Re-run only after deleting `workspace.yaml`.

After scaffolding, re-run the test suite to confirm the restructure didn't
break anything; then move on to Phase 5 (showcase investigation + published
read-only workbench).

### Phase 5: Showcase Investigation + Published Read-only Workbench

Heavy mode's terminus is no longer a standalone `demo/report.html`. It is a
**showcase investigation** — a real `investigations/<tool>-showcase/` bound
to one or more `studies/`, each with a genuine `expected_behavior` /
`behavior_tests` pair, a canonical runner that drives the real bridge and
renders a committed interactive visualization, and runs recorded into the
workspace's `.pbg/runs.jsonl` log — published as a self-contained read-only
workbench bundle anyone can browse with no server. This mirrors the
`viva-fenics` reference build (seven studies, one investigation, one
published bundle) — read `investigations/fenics-showcase/investigation.yaml`
and any `studies/*/sims/run.py` there for a worked example when in doubt.

#### 1. Scaffold the investigation from the repo's generators

One-liner, driven by the composite generators already implemented in
Phase 3 (`viva_<tool>/composites/*.py`):

```bash
vwb scaffold-investigation \
    --name <tool> \
    --studies viva_<tool>.composites.<topic1>.<gen1>,viva_<tool>.composites.<topic2>.<gen2>
```

(comma-separated composite-generator names — fully-qualified or short, one
per showcase study). This emits:

- `investigations/<tool>-showcase/investigation.yaml` (schema_version 2:
  `question`/`hypothesis`/`description`, `studies:` list, an `executive`
  block — `what_is_this`/`verdict`/`verdict_status`/`decisions_needed` — a
  `scientific_argument` block — `main_claim`/`evidence_for`/
  `evidence_against`/`key_figures`/`caveats` — and `acceptance_criteria`
  mapping `{study, behavior}` pairs).
- One skeleton `studies/<slug>/study.yaml` per generator (schema_version 4),
  each with a stubbed `expected_behavior`/`behavior_tests` pair, a linear
  `pipeline_gate.prerequisites` chain across the batch, and a
  `canonical_runs` entry pointing at `studies/<slug>/sims/run.py`.

Existing `investigation.yaml`/`study.yaml` files are never overwritten
(pass `--force` only if you intentionally want to re-stub one).

#### 2. Fill each study: real behavior + a runner that produces interactive viz

For every scaffolded study, replace the stubs with the real content:

- **`expected_behavior` + `behavior_tests`** — state a genuine, falsifiable
  claim about the wrapped tool's output (a tolerance against a known
  analytic/theoretical result, a conservation law, a monotonicity or
  convergence-order check — not "it runs without error"), using the
  `en` / `measure` / `expect` grammar. See
  [docs/concepts/expected-behavior-grammar.md](../../docs/concepts/expected-behavior-grammar.md)
  for the full grammar reference and worked examples.
- **`studies/<slug>/sims/run.py`** — the study's canonical runner
  (referenced by `canonical_runs[].script`, resolved relative to the
  **workspace root**, not the study dir). It must:
  1. Build the composite via the workspace's `build_core()` (see **Auto-Discovery Convention**).
  2. Run it with `Composite.run(...)`.
  3. Render an **interactive** visualization — Plotly for 2D/time-series/
     animated data, Three.js for 3D/spatial data — to
     `studies/<slug>/viz/<name>.html`. **Invoke the `dataviz` skill** for
     palette/theming before writing chart code: this viz is the showcase's
     headline artifact and replaces the old report, so it must look
     considered, not default-matplotlib. Commit the rendered `viz/*.html`.
     If you inline a Plotly CDN `<script>` tag rather than using
     `fig.write_html(..., include_plotlyjs="cdn")`, pin it to
     `https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.7.0.min.js` — **not** `plotly-2.27.0`.
     Pin the CDN's major version to match the installed `plotly.py`'s major
     version (verify with `plotly.offline.offline.get_plotlyjs_version()`):
     plotly.py ≥6 serializes numpy arrays as compact typed-array JSON
     (`{"dtype": "f8", "bdata": "..."}`), which `plotly-2.27.0.min.js`
     cannot decode — the chart renders blank with no console error.
  4. Record the run via `vivarium_workbench.lib.run_log.append_run_event` —
     a `started` event before the run and a `completed` (or `failed`)
     event after, both keyed by a fresh `run_id`, written against
     `workspace_root` = the **repo root** (not the study dir).
  5. Mirror the rendered `viz/*.html` into the run's per-run viz artifact via
     `vivarium_workbench.lib.run_viz.mirror_viz_dir(WORKSPACE_ROOT, run_id,
     [<rendered paths>])`. This writes `.pbg/runs/<run_id>/viz.json` =
     `{panel_name: html}`, which is what the dashboard **Runs tab's "📊 Viz"**
     action serves (`/api/composite-run/<run_id>/artifact/viz`). Without it the
     run logs fine but its Viz button comes up empty. Keep it best-effort —
     never fail the run on a viz-mirror error (the helper already swallows
     missing/unreadable files; wrap the call in `try/except` if you want belt
     and braces).

    })
    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

#### 3. Run the studies

```bash
python studies/<slug>/sims/run.py    # per study — or:
```

or drive every study's canonical runner via `/viva-study run-script`.
Then verify the runs actually landed in the workspace-level run log:

```bash
python -c "
from vivarium_workbench.lib.run_log import fold_runs_jsonl
import pathlib
print(len(fold_runs_jsonl(pathlib.Path('.'))), 'runs')
"
```

#### 4. Emit publish assets and build the read-only bundle

```bash
vwb add-dashboard --workspace . \
    --base-path /viva-<tool>/dashboard \
    --interactive-url https://github.com/vivarium-collective/viva-<tool>
vivarium-workbench-publish --workspace . --out reports/published/dashboard \
    --base-path /viva-<tool>/dashboard
```

`emit(...)` writes `scripts/publish_dashboard.sh` (executable) and
`.github/workflows/publish-dashboard.yml` — the same publish flow every
`viva-*` workspace ships (see **README Requirements** below for the
gh-pages side of this). Open `reports/published/dashboard/index.html` and
click into each study to confirm its interactive viz renders read-only
(no live server, no Launch buttons — that's expected for a snapshot).

**Interactive viz now lives in each study's `viz/` directory** (snapshotted
verbatim into the published workbench), **not** in `demo/report.html` —
there is no `demo/` directory and no standalone report in heavy mode's
final deliverable.

**The terminal state of heavy mode is `/viva-report` (no flags) on the
showcase investigation.** A verdict nobody has audited against the charts is
not reviewer-ready.

## README Requirements

Include:

1. What the wrapper does
2. Installation — PyPI is the primary install path; editable install for development:
   ```
   # From PyPI (recommended):
   pip install viva-<tool>
   # or with uv:
   uv pip install viva-<tool>

   # For development (editable):
   uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
   Include a note on auto-discovery:
   > Once installed, processes register automatically via
   > `bigraph_schema.package.discover` — no manual `register_link()` calls
   > are needed.
3. Quick start
4. API reference table
5. Architecture mapping
6. **A prominent, AUTO-MAINTAINED link to the published read-only workbench.**
   Don't hand-write the URL — put the marker pair near the TOP of the README
   (right after the `# <title>` line):
   ```
   <!-- BEGIN:dashboard -->
   <!-- END:dashboard -->
   ```
   then run `vivarium-workbench gen-readme --workspace .`. It fills the block
   with a prominent callout linking
   `https://vivarium-collective.github.io/viva-<tool>/dashboard/` — the URL is
   derived from the git remote, so there's no per-repo config and nothing to
   keep in sync by hand. Wire `vivarium-workbench gen-readme --check` into CI so
   the block never goes stale. (The `publish-dashboard.yml` workflow from
   `publish_assets.emit` in Phase 5 keeps the dashboard itself live on every
   push to `main`.) Also point at the showcase investigation
   (`investigations/<tool>-showcase/`) and how to run a study locally
   (`python studies/<slug>/sims/run.py`).
7. Expected outputs (the behavior-test verdicts from each study)
8. Notes on authentication, if relevant
9. Limitations and assumptions

## CONTRIBUTING.md Requirements

Include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with at minimum:

```markdown
# Contributing to viva-<tool>

## Development setup

uv is required. Install with `brew install uv` or `pip install uv`.

    uv venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    pytest

## Releasing to PyPI

Tag a commit with `git tag v<VERSION>` and push the tag. The
`.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow publishes to PyPI automatically
using trusted publishing (no tokens needed after initial setup).

PyPI trusted publishing must be configured once per repo. See
https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/ and
[docs/conventions/distribution.md](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/viva-superpowers/blob/main/docs/conventions/distribution.md).
```

## Final Validation and Commit

After implementation (including the Phase 4.5 workspace promotion and the
Phase 5 showcase investigation):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install the package so allocate_core() + the composite-generator registry
# pick it up. Hatchling's editable install does NOT emit top_level.txt,
# which breaks bigraph-schema's distribution-keyed discovery — use a regular
# install for the final validation (uv pip install . without -e). (pixi-managed
# repos: `pixi run pytest` etc. — the editable install is already handled by
# `pixi install`, see build_core() in Auto-Discovery Convention.)
uv pip install .

pytest
python scripts/lint-workspace.py    # must print "workspace lint: OK"

# Confirm the generator(s) are visible to the dashboard's discovery path.
python -c "
from process_bigraph.composite_generator import discover_generators
gens = discover_generators()
matches = [g for g in gens if 'viva_<tool>' in g]
assert matches, 'no <tool> generators discovered'
print('discovered:', matches)
"

# Run every showcase study and confirm the runs landed in the run log.
for f in studies/*/sims/run.py; do python "$f"; done
python -c "
from vivarium_workbench.lib.run_log import fold_runs_jsonl
import pathlib
n = len(fold_runs_jsonl(pathlib.Path('.')))
assert n > 0, 'no runs recorded in .pbg/runs.jsonl'
print(n, 'runs recorded')
"

# Build the published read-only bundle (see Phase 5, step 4) and confirm it
# has content.
bash scripts/publish_dashboard.sh reports/published/dashboard "/viva-<tool>/dashboard"
test -f reports/published/dashboard/index.html

git add -A
git commit -m "Initial viva-<tool> wrapper: workspace, processes, composite generators, showcase investigation, tests, README"
python -c "import os, webbrowser; webbrowser.open('file://' + os.path.abspath('reports/published/dashboard/index.html'))"
```

Do not push.

## Optional GitHub Pages Deployment

Only do this after the user explicitly approves pushing to GitHub, and only
if `publish_assets.emit` (Phase 5, step 4) hasn't already wired it up as CI.
The normal path is **not** a manual deploy step — `publish-dashboard.yml`
(emitted alongside `scripts/publish_dashboard.sh`) publishes the read-only
workbench to `gh-pages:dashboard/` automatically on every push to `main`,
and features the live URL in `README.md`. The only manual action is a
one-time repo setting:

```bash
GITHUB_ORG="<your-github-org-or-username>"
TOOL_NAME="<tool>"

# One-time: Settings → Pages → Source = "Deploy from a branch" → gh-pages.
# publish-dashboard.yml bootstraps the gh-pages branch itself on first run
# (push to main, or `gh workflow run publish-dashboard.yml`) — there is no
# manual `git checkout --orphan gh-pages` step.
gh api -X POST "repos/${GITHUB_ORG}/viva-${TOOL_NAME}/pages" \
  -f 'source[branch]=gh-pages' \
  -f 'source[path]=/' || true
```

Then verify:

```bash
curl -sI "https://${GITHUB_ORG}.github.io/viva-${TOOL_NAME}/dashboard/"
```

A `200` response means the read-only workbench is live.

Optional wrapper-pattern references (study their bridge implementations and showcase investigations if available):

- `viva-fenics` — canonical showcase-investigation + pixi + `build_core()` template (look at `investigations/fenics-showcase/investigation.yaml`, any `studies/*/sims/run.py`, `viva_fenics/core.py`, and `pixi.toml`). The worked example for the whole of **Phase 5** above.
- `pbg-compucell3d` — conda-only tool managed via pixi (no PyPI wheel for the simulator itself); precedent for the **Conda-only tools** subsection above.

If you have local clones of any of the above, prefer reading them directly. Otherwise, work from the patterns documented in this skill.

---

## Reproduction Mode

Invoked when `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--reproduce` (alias `--reimplement`).
This is the **opt-in exception** to the default of bridging the real tool.
Use it only when the user explicitly asks, or when you've determined the real
tool can't be installed/run in the target environment and the user accepts a
clean-room reimplementation.

The contract: produce a `<Tool>ReproductionProcess` that re-implements the
tool's published algorithm (from its paper, docs, and source) in portable
Python/NumPy — **honestly labeled as a reproduction**, never passed off as the
tool itself.

Follow the same heavy- or lightweight-mode mechanics as normal (sibling repo
vs. in-workspace file), with these differences:

1. **Class name is `<Tool>ReproductionProcess`**, not `<Tool>Process`. Reserve
   the bare `<Tool>Process` name for a real bridge — if you also author a
   guarded real bridge (recommended when the blocker is environmental, not
   fundamental), it keeps the headline name and the reproduction stays
   secondary.
2. **Module docstring states plainly** that this re-implements `<Tool>`'s design
   in Python and is not the upstream binary; cite the upstream repo/paper and
   the version/commit you reproduced from.
3. **README/REPRODUCTION notes** must list known divergences from upstream
   (numerical scheme, precision, features omitted) and how to validate against
   the real tool when a capable environment is available.
4. **When the real tool is merely environment-blocked** (GPU-only, remote-only),
   still scaffold the real `<Tool>Process` bridge alongside — lazily importing
   and raising a clear `RuntimeError("<Tool> requires <X>; set <ENV>…")` where
   it can't run — so the package is correct everywhere and runnable where the
   environment allows. Tests for the bridge skip (not fail) when the dependency
   is absent (`shutil.which(...)` / `importorskip`).
5. **Composites and demos** default to the reproduction (so they run anywhere),
   clearly tagged "(reproduction)"; add a parallel real-tool composite tagged
   with its requirement (e.g. "(requires CUDA)").

Everything else — ports, composite-spec/generator discovery, workspace
promotion, tests, showcase investigation + publish — is identical to the
matching default mode.

---

## Mock Mode

Invoked when `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--mock` (alias `--stub`). This is the
**explicit, opt-in** way to produce a non-functional placeholder. It is never
chosen automatically and never a fallback when the real bridge is hard — if
the real bridge is difficult, keep working it or ask the user, do not silently
land here.

Use mock mode only when the user explicitly wants a scaffold to:

- prototype/validate the **wiring** of a composite before the real tool is
  ready or installed,
- stand up the ports + schema surface so sibling processes can be developed in
  parallel, or
- produce a runnable smoke target in CI where installing the real tool is out
  of scope for now.

The contract: produce a `<Tool>MockProcess` that has the **same port and
config surface** the real wrapper would have, but whose `update()` returns
cheap, clearly-fake values (zeros, echoes of input, a tiny deterministic
function) — **honestly labeled as a mock**, never passed off as the tool or as
a reproduction of its science.

Follow the same heavy- or lightweight-mode mechanics as normal (sibling repo
vs. in-workspace file), with these differences:

1. **Class name is `<Tool>MockProcess`**, not `<Tool>Process` and not
   `<Tool>ReproductionProcess`. Reserve the bare `<Tool>Process` name for a
   real bridge so a later real implementation can take the headline name
   without a rename cascade.
2. **Module + class docstring state plainly** that this is a non-functional
   placeholder that does NOT run `<Tool>` and does NOT reproduce its
   algorithm; it exists only for wiring/scaffolding. Include a `# TODO:`
   pointing at the real-bridge work that should replace it.
3. **Ports are designed for real, not faked.** Spend the effort to get
   `inputs()`, `outputs()`, and `config_schema` right (bare `float` deltas,
   structural `map`/`list`, etc. per **Port Design**) so the mock is a
   drop-in shape for the eventual real bridge. The fakeness lives only inside
   `update()`.
4. **`update()` is obviously inert** — return zeros / echo inputs / a trivial
   deterministic transform. Do not approximate the tool's math (that would be
   a reproduction, not a mock). A one-line comment must say so.
5. **Tests assert shape, not science** — instantiation, that `inputs()` /
   `outputs()` return dicts, and that one `update()` call returns the declared
   output ports. Do not assert numerical fidelity.
6. **Composites and demos** built on a mock must be tagged "(mock)" wherever a
   human or the dashboard surfaces them, so nobody mistakes placeholder output
   for real results.

Everything else — composite-spec/generator discovery, workspace promotion,
showcase investigation + publish scaffolding — is identical to the matching
default mode. When the user
later asks for the real wrapper, the mock's ports carry over and only
`update()` (and the deps) change.

---

## Composite Mode

When `$ARGUMENTS` contains two or more tokens, the first token is `<name>` (the composite name) and the remaining tokens are the simulator/wrapper names to compose.

### Target directory

```bash
COMPOSITE_NAME="<name>"
WORKSPACE="${VIVA_WORKSPACE:-$HOME/code}"
REPO_DIR="${WORKSPACE}/viva-${COMPOSITE_NAME}-composite"
```

Check whether the directory already exists. If it does, stop and ask the user to overwrite, use a suffix, or abort.

### Repo setup

```bash
mkdir -p "$REPO_DIR"
cd "$REPO_DIR"
git init

uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install process-bigraph bigraph-schema bigraph-viz pytest matplotlib plotly
```

Install each wrapper from a local sibling clone (preferred) or PyPI:

```bash
uv pip install -e "${WORKSPACE}/viva-<tool1>"   # editable local clone
uv pip install viva-<tool2>                     # or from PyPI if published
```

Write `.gitignore` (same as single-tool mode — exclude `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, `output/`, `.idea/`).

### Deliverables for composite mode

Same workspace-shaped layout as single-tool mode — `workspace.yaml` at
root, `references/` + `scripts/` scaffolded, registered in
`~/.pbg/workspaces.json`, plus the same showcase-investigation +
published-workbench terminus (Phase 5). The package gains a
`composites/` subpackage whose `@composite_generator` wraps the
hand-built `document.py` output:

```text

```

### Workflow (composite mode)

#### Step 1: Inventory the wrappers

For each `viva-<tool>`, read its `processes.py` and record:

- Class name and registered link string.
- All `inputs()` ports and schemas.
- All `outputs()` ports and schemas.
- Whether it exposes `register_types(core)`.
- Natural time scale (from its demo's `interval`).

Produce a markdown table for the user to review:

| Tool | Class | Port | Direction | Schema |
|---|---|---|---|---|

#### Step 2: Classify every cross-process connection

Enumerate every (producer-port, consumer-port) pair and classify each into one of:

| Case | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Pass-through** | Same logical quantity, same schema after `core.resolve` | Wire both to the same store path — no adapter. |
| **Adapter** | Same logical quantity, different units/keying/shape | Insert a `Step` adapter with two stores. |
| **Stub source** | Consumer needs an input no wrapped process produces | Add a stub Process/Step. |
| **Sink** | Producer's output has no consumer | Wire to `_sinks` store + emitter; do not drop silently. |

Present the connection table to the user before writing code. Never mark a row "pass-through" if schemas differ.

Encode the table in `wiring.py` as a `WIRING` dict (see the **Lightweight Mode** section below for the dict format reference).

#### Step 3: Build core and document

`core.py` exposes `build_core()` that calls `allocate_core()` and registers all wrappers, adapters, stubs, and `RAMEmitter`. See wiring and composition patterns in the **Lightweight Mode** section below.

`document.py` exposes `build_document()` that returns the full Composite document using paths from `WIRING`.

#### Step 4: Validate

```python
from process_bigraph import Composite
from viva_<name>_composite.core import build_core
from viva_<name>_composite.document import build_document

core = build_core()
sim = Composite({"state": build_document()}, core=core)
sim.run(1.0)
```

If `Composite()` raises, schemas didn't reconcile — report the offending store path. If `run()` raises, wiring is wrong.

#### Step 5: Tests

Three test files:

- `test_adapters.py` — unit-test each adapter and stub directly (no Composite).
- `test_assembly.py` — instantiate the Composite without error (schema-reconciliation check).
- `test_run.py` — run for the largest declared interval and assert state propagated through every adapter chain.

#### Step 6: Showcase investigation + published read-only workbench

Same terminus as single-tool mode's **Phase 5** — scaffold the investigation
from the composite's own generator(s), author real `expected_behavior` /
`behavior_tests` per study, and write each study's `sims/run.py` to build
via `build_core()`, run the composite, and render an interactive viz. For
composite mode specifically, make sure the studies collectively demonstrate:

1. **The wiring/coupling itself** — at least one study whose viz plots two
   composed tools' outputs on the same time axis, showing the coupling is
   real (not two independent traces overlaid by accident).
2. **Cross-process metrics** — the shared stores from `wiring.py`, not just
   per-tool internals.
3. **A decoupled-vs-coupled comparison** — ideally as two baselines
   (or two studies) so a reader can see what the coupling adds.

Then run `investigation-from-wrapper`, fill in the studies, run them,
verify `.pbg/runs.jsonl`, and publish exactly as in Phase 5 steps 1-4.

#### Step 7: README

Include: science motivation, which tools are composed and where to find their wrappers, installation (including editable-local-clone install), a wiring diagram, wiring table, quick start, a link to the published read-only workbench, and known limitations.

#### Step 7.5: Promote to a discoverable pbg-workspace

Same ritual as single-tool mode's Phase 4.5 — `workspace.yaml`,
`scripts/`, dashboard catalog registration. Wrap the composite's
`build_document` in a `@composite_generator` (in
`viva_<name>_composite/composites/<name>.py`) so the dashboard's Composites
tab can run it with parameter sweeps:

```python
from process_bigraph.composite_generator import composite_generator
from ..document import build_document

@composite_generator(
    name="<name>",
    description="<one-line: which tools are composed and the science>",
    parameters={
        # Surface only the knobs you actually want the dashboard to sweep.
        "interval": {"type": "float", "default": 1.0,
                     "description": "Composite tick size"},
    },
)
def <name>(core=None, *, interval=1.0):
    return build_document(interval=interval)
```

Run the scaffolder + catalog add:

```bash
vwb scaffold-workspace \
    --in-place --name <name>-composite --target . \
    --package viva_<name>_composite --branch main
vwb catalog-add \
    --path "$(pwd)" --name <name>-composite --package viva_<name>_composite
python scripts/lint-workspace.py
```

#### Step 8: Commit

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install .                   # non-editable so discovery sees the package
pytest
python scripts/lint-workspace.py

# Run every showcase study, verify .pbg/runs.jsonl, publish the bundle —
# same as single-tool mode's Final Validation.
for f in studies/*/sims/run.py; do python "$f"; done
bash scripts/publish_dashboard.sh reports/published/dashboard "/viva-<name>-composite/dashboard"

git add -A
git commit -m "Initial viva-<name>-composite: workspace, generators, wiring, showcase investigation, tests"
python -c "import os, webbrowser; webbrowser.open('file://' + os.path.abspath('reports/published/dashboard/index.html'))"
```

Do not push.

## Start

Given `$ARGUMENTS` (strip recognized flags first; they may appear in any order):

- **Default intent is the REAL tool.** "Wrap `<tool>`" means install/build the
  actual upstream simulator and bridge to it — not reimplement its math, not
  stub it out. Keep trying even when the build is difficult; never downgrade to
  a reproduction or a mock on your own. See **The Default: wrap the REAL tool**
  at the top.
- If `--reproduce` (alias `--reimplement`) is present: run **Reproduction Mode** — build a labeled `<Tool>ReproductionProcess`, keeping the bare `<Tool>Process` name for a (possibly guarded) real bridge.
- If `--mock` (alias `--stub`) is present: run **Mock Mode** — build a labeled, non-functional `<Tool>MockProcess` placeholder for wiring/scaffolding only. Opt-in only; never a fallback for a hard real-bridge build. (`--mock` and `--reproduce` are mutually exclusive.)
- If `--lightweight` (alias `--in-workspace`) is present: run **Lightweight Mode** with the remaining args.
- Else if one positional arg: study the tool, install the real upstream simulator, create `viva-<tool>/`,
  implement the package with **`@composite_generator`-decorated
  composites under `viva_<tool>/composites/`**, test it, **promote it to a
  pbg-workspace via `scaffold workspace --in-place` and register it in
  the dashboard catalog**, then **scaffold the showcase investigation
  (`investigation-from-wrapper`), author each study's `expected_behavior` +
  `behavior_tests` + `sims/run.py` with a committed interactive viz, run the
  studies into `.pbg/runs.jsonl`, publish the read-only workbench, and open
  the published bundle** (Phase 5) — commit locally.
- Else if two or more positional args: inventory the listed wrappers,
  design the wiring table, build `viva-<name>-composite/` (workspace-shaped
  with a top-level `@composite_generator` wrapping `build_document`),
  validate, test, **promote to a pbg-workspace and register it**, then
  **scaffold the showcase investigation, author studies + interactive viz,
  run into `.pbg/runs.jsonl`, publish the read-only workbench, and open the
  published bundle** (same terminus as single-tool mode) — commit locally.

---

## Lightweight Mode

Invoked when `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--lightweight` or `--in-workspace`. Strip that flag and dispatch on the remaining positional count.

This mode produces a single file inside the **current workspace's** `viva_<slug>/` package plus a test. No sibling repo, no README, no showcase investigation, no publish, no commit. The dashboard's active-branch workstream is the canonical commit surface — this mode leaves the working tree dirty so the user (or the dashboard's Push button) commits when ready.

**Lightweight does not mean mock.** The default is still a **real bridge** —
an `update()` that lazily imports and drives the genuine tool. The only thing
"lightweight" drops is the surrounding repo scaffolding (README, showcase
investigation + publish, sibling repo, commit), not the fidelity of the
wrapper. Emit a placeholder
only under `--mock` (see below).

### Common preconditions

1. Walk up from cwd to find `workspace.yaml`. Fail with a clear message if absent.
2. Read `package_path` from `workspace.yaml`; default to `viva_<workspace_name_underscored>` if missing.
3. NEVER install simulator dependencies — that's a separate step (`/viva-catalog install <pkg>` or manual `uv pip install`). The real bridge therefore **lazily imports** the tool inside `update()` / a `_build_model()` helper, so the file is valid even before the dependency is installed; the import only fires at run time.
4. NEVER modify `workspace.yaml`. The Process/Composite lives in code, not metadata.
5. NEVER auto-commit.

### Lightweight single-tool form

`/viva-expert --lightweight <tool>`

Default (real bridge) steps:

1. Create `viva_<slug>/processes/` if missing (touch `__init__.py`).
2. **Study the tool's API first** (its docs/source/examples — read enough to
   know the real call surface). If it's already importable in the workspace
   venv, run a one-liner to confirm the entry points; if it isn't installed,
   work from its published API and lazily import inside the bridge.
3. Write `viva_<slug>/processes/<tool>.py` containing:
   - Module docstring naming the simulator and stating this is a real bridge.
   - `from process_bigraph import Process`.
   - Class `<Tool>Process(Process)` with:
     - `config_schema` — real config knobs the tool needs at construction.
     - `def inputs(self)` — the actual input ports a sibling could write
       (substrates, environment, control signals) per **Port Design**.
     - `def outputs(self)` — the tool's real outputs as composable types
       (bare `float` deltas, structural `map`/`list`).
     - `def update(self, state, interval)` — **drives the genuine tool**:
       lazily import it, push `state` in, run for `interval`, read results
       back as schema-compatible values (delta against previous reading where
       the tool reports absolute state). See the **Bridge Pattern** section.
4. Write `tests/test_<tool>.py`:
   - Import the class; assert `inputs()` / `outputs()` return dicts.
   - A bridge-run test that actually calls `update()`, guarded to **skip**
     (not fail) when the dependency is absent (`pytest.importorskip("<pkg>")`
     or `shutil.which(...)`), so CI without the tool installed stays green
     while a dev machine with it exercises the real path.
5. Print a short summary listing the two files, whether the tool import
   succeeded locally, and the "working tree is now dirty" hint.

If you cannot determine the tool's real API at all (no docs, no source, name
unrecognized), **stop and ask the user** — do not silently emit a stub. Offer
`--mock` as the explicit scaffolding path if that's what they want.

Example:

```text
/viva-expert --lightweight tellurium     # in a workspace called chromosome-rep1

  viva_chromosome_rep1/processes/tellurium.py    # TelluriumProcess — real bridge
  tests/test_tellurium.py                        # shape + importorskip run test
```

### Lightweight mock form

`/viva-expert --lightweight --mock <tool>`

Same file layout as the real form, but the class is `<Tool>MockProcess` and
`update()` is a labeled, inert placeholder (zeros / echo / trivial transform).
Follow **Mock Mode** above for the contract (honest docstring, real port
surface, shape-only tests, "(mock)" tagging). Use this only when the user
explicitly asks for a scaffold.

```text
/viva-expert --lightweight --mock tellurium   # explicit placeholder

  viva_chromosome_rep1/processes/tellurium.py    # TelluriumMockProcess (labeled)
  tests/test_tellurium.py                        # shape-only smoke test
```

### Lightweight composite form

`/viva-expert --lightweight <name> <tool1> <tool2> [...]`

Two or more `<tool>` args after `<name>`. Each `<tool>` must be an already-installed importable package (e.g. `viva_tellurium`). If any is missing, abort and direct the user at `/viva-catalog install <pkg>` or the Registry tab.

Steps:

1. Verify each `<tool>` is importable. If any are missing, report and abort.
2. Create `viva_<slug>/composites/` if missing (touch `__init__.py`).
3. Write `viva_<slug>/composites/<name>.py` containing:
   - Module docstring naming the composite and its participants.
   - Imports for each tool's Process class (use `__all__` or known process names from the package).
   - A `build_composite(core=None) -> Composite` function that:
     - Calls `allocate_core()` if `core` is None.
     - Builds a state dict referencing each Process at a path (e.g. `simulation/tellurium`, `simulation/cobra`).
     - Wires the processes via shared stores (best-effort guess based on `inputs()` / `outputs()` — leave wires as `# TODO:` if ambiguous).
     - Adds a `RAMEmitter` capturing the shared stores.
     - Returns `Composite({'state': state}, core=core)`.
   - An `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that runs `build_composite().run(10)` and prints a summary.
4. Write `tests/test_<name>_composite.py` — minimal smoke test:
   - Call `build_composite()`.
   - Assert the result is a `Composite`.
   - Run for 1 timestep and verify no exception.
5. Print a summary listing the two files, any `# TODO:` wires left, and "Run from terminal: `python -m viva_<slug>.composites.<name>`".

Example:

```text
/viva-expert --lightweight metabolism viva_cobra viva_tellurium  # in chromosome-rep1

  viva_chromosome_rep1/composites/metabolism.py    # build_composite()
  tests/test_metabolism_composite.py              # smoke test
```

### When to use lightweight vs. heavy

| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| A real bridge to a tool inside an existing workspace without a sibling repo | `--lightweight <tool>` |
| To compose two installed wrappers inside the workspace before deciding to publish | `--lightweight <name> <t1> <t2>` |
| A publication-ready sibling `viva-<tool>/` repo with README, tests, a showcase investigation + published read-only workbench, PR | (heavy) `/viva-expert <tool>` |
| A composite repo `viva-<name>-composite/` with wiring table, validation, showcase investigation + published workbench | (heavy) `/viva-expert <name> <t1> <t2>` |
| A clean-room reimplementation of the tool's published algorithm (honest, labeled) | add `--reproduce` |
| A non-functional placeholder to scaffold wiring before the real tool is ready | add `--mock` |

Fidelity (`--reproduce` / `--mock`) and packaging (`--lightweight` vs heavy)
are independent axes — combine freely, e.g. `--lightweight --mock <tool>` for
an in-workspace placeholder, or `--reproduce <tool>` for a heavy clean-room
repo. With no fidelity flag, you always get the **real bridge**.
