# /viva-study — detailed reference

Full per-subcommand specs, flags, examples, and the implementation outline for [`/viva-study`](SKILL.md). Sub-commands are organized by lifecycle phase (Design → Build → Simulate → Evaluate → Decide); see SKILL.md for the compact index and the doctrine (house rules, layout, rigor pass, etc.).

## Sub-commands

### Design subcommands

#### `new <composite-id>`

Create a new Study seeded with one baseline composite. The dashboard's seed endpoint writes a **v4-shape `study.yaml`** with the 14-section narrative spine commented in as TODO placeholders (the same shape the v2ecoli dnaa-replication investigation evolved through use):

- **Executive layer** — `runtime` · ★ `report` · ★ `study_card`
- **Framing layer** — ★ `question` + `assumptions` · ★ `conditions` (baseline + variants + model_settings) · `enforced_params`
- **Validation layer** — ★ `behavior_tests` · ★ `readouts` · `biological_summary` · `literature_anchors`
- **Implementation + decisions** — `model_change` · `implementation_requirements` · `design_pivot_required` · ★ `conclusion_verdicts`

★ sections are the ones to author first — they render at the top of the rendered study page. All v4 fields are optional per `study.schema.json`, so the scaffold is lint-clean on day one and the user opts in by uncommenting + filling sections. See `template/NEXT_STEPS.md` in pbg-template for the full walking guide.

POST `/api/study-create`:

```json
{"name": "<study-name>", "source": "<composite-id>"}
```

Returns the new study's name + URL. Print and offer to open it via `/viva-study open <name>`. After scaffolding, the immediate next step is `/viva-study fill-overview <slug>` to draft the question/hypothesis/objective fields, then uncomment the ★ sections in the YAML and fill them as you build.

#### `fill-overview <slug> [--from-plan <path>] [--from-expert <path>...] [--fields <comma-list>] [--dry-run]`

Draft the `question`, `hypothesis`, `objective`, and/or `description` fields of an existing study by reading its linked plan and expert documents, then write them via the API after user confirmation.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study slug under `studies/<slug>/`. Abort with a clear error pointing at `/viva-study new` if the directory or `study.yaml` is absent.
- `--from-plan <path>` (optional) — path to a planning PDF or markdown that decomposes the study's intent. If absent, look inside `references/expert/` for a file whose name matches `<slug>` or contains the word "plan".
- `--from-expert <path>` (optional, repeatable) — additional expert-knowledge PDFs or markdown files. If absent, consult `workspace.yaml.expert_docs` and use any entry whose `claims_supported` list overlaps with the study's `parent_studies` or `id`.
- `--fields <comma-list>` (optional) — restrict drafting to a subset. Default fields: `claim,experiment,result,question` — the study Overview is a **Claim → Test → Result** spine (plus the `question` that heads the page). The legacy `hypothesis`/`objective`/`description` fields are DEPRECATED (superseded by `claim`/`experiment`/`result`); draft them only if named explicitly. v4 narrative fields are opt-in via `--include-narrative` (see below) or by naming them explicitly: `report,study_card,biological_summary`.
- `--include-narrative` (optional) — extend the default draft set with the v4 narrative-spine fields: `report` (verdict + confidence + evidence_quality + main_insight + caveat), `study_card` (goal + mechanism + why_before_next + expected_result + main_expert_question), `biological_summary` (multi-paragraph mechanism prose). Drafted from the same plan + expert PDFs.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff and stop without writing anything.

**Behavior (steps Claude follows when running this subcommand):**

1. **Resolve study.** Read `studies/<slug>/study.yaml`. If the study doesn't exist, abort: "Study '<slug>' not found. Run `/viva-study new` to create it."

2. **Discover source docs.** Resolve `--from-plan` and each `--from-expert` path (relative to the workspace root). If neither flag is given:
   - Scan `references/expert/` for files whose filename (lowercased, without extension) contains the slug or the substring "plan".
   - Also check `workspace.yaml` under `expert_docs` for any entry whose `claims_supported` overlaps with the study's `id` or `parent_studies`.
   - If no docs are found, warn the user and offer to continue with only the study.yaml context.

3. **Read source material.** Use the Read tool on each resolved doc. If a doc is a PDF, read all pages.

4. **Draft each requested field.** For each field in `--fields`:

   The study Overview renders **Claim → Test → Result** (each a single, direct statement); draft those first.

   - `claim:` — One sentence. The compositional idea this study tests, stated direct and concise, no hedging: what we claim can be done or is true (e.g. "One metabolic interface can be realized by many mechanisms without changing what the interface exposes."). This is the **Claim** at the top of the Overview and the investigation-graph node's "Finds" line.

   - `experiment:` — One paragraph. What was built and run to test the claim — the **Test** in the Overview. Name the mechanism/composite installed behind the interface and what is measured; concrete and imperative (e.g. "Install three handlers behind the same interface and run each as a closed-loop batch…").

   - `result:` — One paragraph. What happened and what it establishes — the **Result** in the Overview. State the outcome and the conservation/invariant it confirms; the `findings` supply the measured evidence.

   - `question:` — One paragraph (at most four sentences), scientifically framed as a measurable prediction, ending with `?`. Still heads the study page above the Overview. When the plan names a specific section or heading that motivates the question, cite it parenthetically (e.g., "per §3.2 of the plan"). Keep it concise.

   - `hypothesis:` / `objective:` / `description:` (DEPRECATED — draft only if named explicitly) — superseded by `claim` / `experiment` / `result`. If drafted: `hypothesis` = predicted outcome (quantitative thresholds only when in the source docs); `objective` = imperative statement of what the study builds/measures; `description` = two-to-four paragraphs of scientific context.

   **v4 narrative-spine fields** (drafted only when `--include-narrative` or named explicitly in `--fields`; written via `POST /api/study-narrative-set` — `report`, `study_card`, and `biological_summary` are canonical narrative roots the endpoint accepts as dotted-path leaf writes):

   - `report:` — Object with sub-fields. `verdict` defaults to `not-yet-run` until simulations land; `confidence` defaults to `low`; `evidence_quality` defaults to `aspirational`. Draft `objective`, `main_insight`, and `caveat` from the plan's expected-outcome + caveats sections. Leave `conclusion` blank (it's a Decide-phase field). `key_metrics` is hand-authored; do not invent numbers.

   - `study_card:` — Five one-line fields. `goal` is the one-sentence boil-down of the plan's intent. `mechanism` summarizes the biological mechanism in one paragraph. `why_before_next` explains why this study must complete before the next (read parent_studies + expert PDFs for dependencies). `expected_result` paraphrases the literature-stated success criterion. `main_expert_question` is the one question the study most wants an expert to weigh in on.

   - `biological_summary:` — Multi-paragraph plain-English mechanism narrative (the "textbook write-up"). Use 3-5 paragraphs. Markdown allowed. Distinct from `report.main_insight` (one sentence) and `study_card.mechanism` (one paragraph).

   Each draft is a plain string or YAML object suitable for direct insertion into `study.yaml`.

5. **Print preview.** Show a unified diff for each drafted field:
   - If the field currently has a user-authored value, display: `existing:` block then `proposed:` block, with a note that the default action is replace.
   - If the field is empty or missing, display `(empty) → <proposed>`.

6. **Confirm with the user.** Accept three responses:
   - `yes` — proceed to write.
   - `no` — abort without writing; print "No changes made."
   - `edit <field> <new-prompt>` — re-draft only that field using the new prompt, then repeat the preview for it before asking again. Loop until the user says `yes` or `no`.

7. **Write via API.** POST `/api/study-set-description` with only the fields being written:

   ```json
   {"study": "<slug>", "question": "...", "hypothesis": "...", "objective": "...", "description": "..."}
   ```

   The endpoint accepts partial bodies — omit any field not being updated. After the POST, verify by fetching `/api/study/<slug>` and printing the resulting values of the written fields so the user can confirm what landed.

8. **Report.** Print a one-line summary per field: field name, character count before and after, and confirmation that the dashboard now shows the new value.

**Notes for Claude when running fill-overview:**

- Be conservative with hypothesis thresholds. Only state numbers that appear explicitly in the source docs. Prefer "approximately" phrasing over invented precision.
- A `question:` field longer than four sentences is too long — revise.
- If a field already has user-authored content that is substantively different from the draft, present both side-by-side and let the user decide before overwriting.
- `/api/study-set-description` is the canonical study-* endpoint (registered in the workbench as an alias of the underlying `/api/investigation-set-overview`). Prefer the study-* name in new skill code; the `/api/investigation-set-overview` form is the v2 alias kept for backwards compatibility. There is no `/api/study-set-overview` route.

#### `set-objective <study-name> '<text>'`

Replace the Study's objective. POST `/api/study-set-objective`:

```json
{"study": "<study-name>", "text": "<text>"}
```

#### `baseline-add <study-name> --name <n> --composite <id> [--params '<json>']`

Append a composite to the Study's baseline list. POST `/api/study-baseline-add`:

}
```

`name` must be unique within the Study's baseline. 409 on duplicate.

#### `baseline-remove <study-name> --name <n>`

Remove a baseline composite by name. POST `/api/study-baseline-remove`:

```json
{"study": "<study-name>", "name": "<baseline-entry-name>"}
```

Refuses with 409 if any variant has `base_composite` pointing to the entry (error body includes `dependents: [...]` listing the blocking variants). Refuses with 400 if removal would leave the baseline empty.

#### `variant-add <study-name> --name <n> --base-composite <baseline-name> [--params '<json>']`

Add a variant (a perturbation of a baseline composite). POST `/api/study-variant-add`:

```json
{
  "study":               "<study-name>",
  "name":                "<unique-variant-name>",
  "base_composite":      "<baseline-entry-name>",
  "parameter_overrides": { "k": 2, ... }
}
```

`base_composite` must reference an existing entry in `baseline[]`. 404 on unknown.

```

#### `add-literature-anchor <slug> --expectation '<text>' --model-observable '<text>' [--source '<text>'] [--status '<text>'] [--cite <bib-key> ...] [--dry-run]`

Append one entry to `studies/<slug>/study.yaml.literature_anchors[]` — a literature expectation paired with the model observable that would falsify or confirm it. Lets a reviewer audit "did we implement this?" without reading code.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--expectation '<text>'` (required) — what the literature claims (e.g., `"DnaA-ATP / total DnaA ≈ 20-50% during steady growth"`).
- `--model-observable '<text>'` (required) — how to measure this in simulation (e.g., `"bulk[DnaA_ATP] / (bulk[DnaA_apo] + bulk[DnaA_ATP] + bulk[DnaA_ADP])"`).
- `--source '<text>'` (optional) — short citation (e.g., `"Boesen 2024 PNAS"`). Prefer `--cite` over `--source` for new entries.
- `--status '<text>'` (optional) — workspace status. Common values: `"Not yet measurable"`, `"Available via X listener"`, `"Partial"`, `"Verified — observed value matches"`. Free-form.
- `--cite <bib-key>` (optional, repeatable) — bib key from the workspace bibliography. Prefer this over `--source`.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff; do not write.

Thin client → `POST /api/study-narrative-command` with `subcommand: add-literature-anchor` — the workbench appends the entry (dedup + atomic write) server-side.

#### `add-pivot <slug> --id <id> --question '<text>' [--alternatives 'A;B;C'] [--status <status>] [--requested-response '<text>'] [--notes '<text>'] [--dry-run]`

Append one entry to `studies/<slug>/study.yaml.design_pivot_required[]` — a named open decision point with its candidate paths. Lets an expert see what choices are blocking forward progress instead of guessing from prose.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--id <id>` (required) — stable slug matching `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$`, unique within this study's `design_pivot_required[]` (e.g., `dnaa-02-EQ-04`). 409-style error on duplicate.
- `--question '<text>'` (required) — the decision being made.
- `--alternatives 'A;B;C'` (optional) — semicolon-separated list of candidate paths (each typically `"A. <one-line description>"`).
- `--status <status>` (optional, default `open`) — `open | accepted | rejected | superseded-by-<slug> | obsolete | resolved`. Free-form.
- `--requested-response '<text>'` (optional) — what the author wants from a reviewer (e.g., `"Expert opinion on whether (A) or (B) is cleaner"`).
- `--notes '<text>'` (optional) — free-form notes.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff; do not write.

YAML-direct subcommand.

#### `add-requirement <slug> --id <id> --title '<text>' [--kind <kind>] [--effort XS|S|M|L|XL] [--status <status>] [--description '<text>'] [--step '<text>' ...] [--unblocks 'a,b,c'] [--defer-until '<text>'] [--dry-run]`

Append one entry to `studies/<slug>/study.yaml.implementation_requirements[]` — a TODO item with status, effort, and what it unblocks. The v4-canonical place to track Build-phase work the study depends on.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--id <id>` (required) — slug unique within the study's `implementation_requirements[]` (e.g., `req-2-intrinsic-hydrolysis-step`). 409-style error on duplicate.
- `--title '<text>'` (required) — one-line description.
- `--kind <kind>` (optional) — common values: `listener | process | parameter_hook | data | state_variables | step`. Free-form.
- `--effort XS|S|M|L|XL` (optional) — t-shirt size. Schema enforces these values.
- `--status <status>` (optional, default `planned`) — common values: `planned | in-progress | done | done-no-op | blocked`. Free-form.
- `--description '<text>'` (optional) — extended description.
- `--step '<text>'` (optional, repeatable) — one step per `--step` flag; collected into `steps[]`.
- `--unblocks 'a,b,c'` (optional) — comma-separated list of test/study names this requirement unblocks when completed.
- `--defer-until '<text>'` (optional) — gating condition; free-form.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff; do not write.

YAML-direct subcommand. Refuses with a clear error if the study's `implementation_requirements` is currently in object shape (rare; v4 expects an array).

### Design→Build gate

#### `verify <slug> [--strict] [--json] [--quiet]`

Spec-verify a study before running it. Catches the cross-reference errors that would otherwise show up only after a Simulate phase: behavior_tests referencing simulations that don't exist, variants pointing at unknown baselines, parent_studies that don't resolve, cite keys missing from the workspace bibliography, findings referencing tests that aren't declared, follow-up proposals linking findings that don't exist.

**What's checked** (workspace-agnostic):

- Every baseline has `name` + `composite`.
- Every variant references a real baseline (`base_composite` resolves).
- Every `simulation_set[].from` references a baseline or variant.
- Every `behavior_tests[].requires_simulation` references a baseline / variant / simulation_set entry.
- Every `behavior_tests[].measure.observable` references a declared `observables[]` entry (soft-skipped when `observables[]` is absent — many workspaces inline measure shapes).
- Every `parent_studies` slug resolves under the workspace.
- Every `cites` bibtex key appears in `references/references.bib` (soft-skipped when no bib file exists).
- Every `findings[].evidence.from_test` (or `from_tests[]`) resolves to a `behavior_tests[].name`.
- Every `followup_proposals[].linked_finding` resolves to a `findings[].id`.

**What's NOT checked** (requires workspace runtime; out of scope for the design→build gate):

- Whether the composite actually accepts the variant's parameter overrides (would require importing the composite — needs the workspace venv).
- Whether observable store paths actually resolve in a real simulation run (would require running the composite or reading initial_state.json — workspace-specific cache layout).

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`. Abort if `study.yaml` is missing.
- `--strict` (optional) — also fail (exit 1) on warnings. Useful in CI.
- `--json` (optional) — emit `{study_yaml, findings, summary}` JSON for tooling.
- `--quiet` (optional) — suppress output on success (still nonzero exit on failure).

**Behavior:**

1. Walk up from cwd to find `workspace.yaml`; read `.pbg/server/server-info` for the URL.
2. `POST /api/study-verify {study: <slug>}` (the workbench runs the pure checker server-side against `studies/<slug>/study.yaml`). A 404 means the study doesn't exist → exit 2.
   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"study": "<slug>"}' "$URL/api/study-verify" | python3 -m json.tool
   ```
   Response: `{study, study_yaml, findings, summary}` — `findings` are `{level, check, field_path, message}` mappings; `summary` carries the `{error, warning, info}` counts.
4. Surface findings grouped by level (error / warning / info). Each finding includes a `check:` identifier, dotted `field_path`, and a one-line message.
5. Exit 0 if clean; exit 1 if any error (or any warning with `--strict`); exit 2 if the study doesn't exist.

**Notes:**

- Thin client — the check set is computed server-side; the pure checker lives in `viva_superpowers/study_verify.py` (backing the endpoint) and its tests pin each check (`tests/test_study_verify.py`).
- Run this after every Design-phase edit. The dashboard's save-time schema validator catches structural errors; `verify` catches semantic cross-reference errors that the schema can't express.

#### `preview-viz <slug> [--name <viz-name>]`

Re-render the study's declared `visualizations[]` against whatever data exists, so a misconfigured viz fails in seconds instead of after a full Simulate phase. POST `/api/investigation-render-viz`:

```json
{"name": "<slug>"}
```

The dashboard builds a 1-step composite for each viz entry, runs it against the workspace's `core`, and writes the rendered HTML to `studies/<slug>/viz/<viz-name>.html`. The response lists the rendered paths and surfaces per-viz render errors so you can fix them before kicking off a long run.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--name <viz-name>` (optional) — server-side filtering by viz name is not yet implemented; this flag is reserved for forward compatibility. Today the endpoint always re-renders all declared viz; the skill still accepts the flag and grep-filters the response client-side.

**Behavior:**

1. Walk up from cwd to find `workspace.yaml`.
2. POST `{name: <slug>}` to `/api/investigation-render-viz`. Surfaces a 404 if the study doesn't exist; a 500 with `error: render failed: ...` if a viz raised.
3. Print the JSON response: `{ok, study, n_visualizations, viz_paths}`. When `--name` is set, restrict the printed `viz_paths` to entries ending with `/<viz-name>.html`.

**Notes:**

- This is the build-phase counterpart of `verify`. `verify` catches static spec errors; `preview-viz` catches dynamic render errors (missing observables in the composite, wrong registry address for the Visualization class, bad config kwargs).
- Repeated invocations are idempotent — each viz HTML is overwritten in place.

#### `check-observables <slug>`

The **never-fabricate observable guard.** Validates every readout the study declares against the *actual* emittable structure of its baseline composite, so the agent never authors a phantom observable — a selector that points at something the composite does not expose. This is the readout-authoring counterpart of `verify`: it answers "can this composite actually emit what the study claims to read out?" before a single simulation step is spent.

Run this whenever you add or edit `readouts[]` (Design/Build phase), and always before `run-baseline`.

**Behavior:**

1. Walk up from cwd to find `workspace.yaml`; ensure the dashboard server is up (read `.pbg/server/server-info` for the base URL).
2. `GET /api/study-observable-check?study=<slug>`. The response is deterministic — the dashboard builds the study's baseline composite and validates each readout against it:

   ```json
   {"composite": "<baseline-composite-ref>",
    "readouts": [{"name": "...", "status": "ok|unresolved|not_in_structure|aspirational", "detail": "..."}]}
   ```

3. Report the per-readout statuses to the user grouped by status. Act on each status as follows:

   - **`ok`** — the selector resolves to a real emittable leaf (or a catalog entry). Nothing to do.
   - **`not_in_structure`** — **the never-fabricate flag.** This readout references an observable the composite does **not** emit. Do NOT leave it. `GET /api/observables?ref=<composite>` to get the composite's real emittable set (`leaves` = dotted paths, `catalogs` = `{observable: [labels]}`), then either (a) re-author the selector to point at an actual `leaf`/`catalog` entry from that set, or (b) remove the readout. **NEVER invent an observable** — only select from the composite's actual `leaves`/`catalogs`. If the intended quantity genuinely isn't emitted, that's a Build-phase gap: the composite must expose it first (raise a `add-requirement`), not the readout pretending it does.
   - **`aspirational`** — the selector is resolved but only verifiable at run time (e.g. `bulk.<id>` ids live in the run-time `bulk__id` column, never in the static structure). Acceptable, but flag it as unverifiable-at-author-time so the user knows it can still fail when the run happens.
   - **`unresolved`** — the readout dialect can't be parsed (e.g. `derived`, an ambiguous multi-id `·` group). Re-author it into a recognized dialect (`store_path`, `identifier`, or canonical `index_by`), or convert it to a bespoke derived computation.

4. If the composite can't be built (response code 422 with all readouts marked `aspirational` + a `note`), surface the build error — the readouts can't be validated until the composite builds. Fix the composite first.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.

**Notes:**

- Deterministic and AI-free on the server side: the endpoints (`/api/study-observable-check` + `/api/observables`) just build the composite and run the pure readout validator; the re-authoring judgment lives here in the skill.
- The composite build is cached (TTL), so repeated `check-observables` / `/api/observables` calls on the same baseline are fast.

#### `migrate-readouts <slug>`

Canonicalize a study's legacy readouts and drive the un-parseable ones to re-authoring. This is the explicit trigger for the readout-migration plumbing (the same canonicalize that `/viva-report` runs automatically before rendering). It does two things — a **safe auto-rewrite** and a **guided re-authoring** — and never guesses a selector.

Run this whenever `verify` / `check-observables` / the report linter flags `readout_migration_status` (migratable or needs_human readouts).

**Behavior:**

1. Walk up from cwd to find `workspace.yaml`; read `.pbg/server/server-info` for the URL. Get the migration status (pure, no write) via `GET /api/study-readout-migration-status`:

   ```bash
   curl -sf "$URL/api/study-readout-migration-status?study=<slug>" | python3 -m json.tool
   # → {study, canonical, migratable, needs_human}
   ```

   Report the three buckets to the user: how many are already `canonical`, how many are `migratable` (safe to rewrite), and how many are `needs_human` (must be re-authored).

2. **Auto-canonicalize the `migratable` set.** These are resolvable readouts whose canonical form differs from the original — a meaning-preserving, comment-safe rewrite. After confirming with the user, write them via `POST /api/study-readout-migrate {study, write: true}`:

   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"study": "<slug>", "write": true}' \
     "$URL/api/study-readout-migrate" | python3 -m json.tool
   # ruamel round-trip; rewrites ONLY the readouts: block
   ```

   The migrate write is idempotent and leaves every `needs_human` readout **untouched** (it only rewrites the resolvable ones). It returns `changed`/`written` flags and a `canonicalized` list — report `len(canonicalized)` (the readouts ACTUALLY rewritten this call), not `len(migrated)` (which also counts already-canonical readouts). On an already-canonical study it is a **true no-op** (`changed=false`, the file is left byte-identical). Hand-authored comments and all non-readout content survive; note that inline comments on an *individual readout entry* are not preserved across canonicalization (the readout dict is rebuilt from its resolved selector).

3. **Re-author each `needs_human` readout.** These are prose `·`-groups, `derived` paths, or ambiguous identifiers the migration refuses to guess. For each one, drive re-authoring against the composite's *real* observables (SP2b-i):

   - `GET /api/observables?ref=<baseline-composite>` (or run `/viva-study check-observables <slug>`) to get the composite's actual emittable set (`leaves` = dotted paths, `catalogs` = `{observable: [labels]}`).
   - Propose a canonical selector (`store_path`, `identifier`, or `index_by`) that points at an **actual** `leaf`/`catalog` entry for the intended quantity. Confirm with the user, then write it.
   - **NEVER invent an observable.** If the intended quantity genuinely isn't emitted, that's a Build-phase gap — the composite must expose it first (`add-requirement`), not the readout pretending it does.

4. Re-call `GET /api/study-readout-migration-status` and report the residual `needs_human` count (the re-authoring queue that's left).

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.

**Notes:**

- The STATUS (`GET /api/study-readout-migration-status`) is pure (no write). The only WRITE is `POST /api/study-readout-migrate {write: true}` — invoked here after user confirmation, and by `/viva-report` before rendering. The re-authoring judgment stays in the skill (AI-free server).
- `needs_human` readouts are never auto-guessed; re-authoring is always a confirmed, observables-grounded edit.

### Simulate subcommands

#### `run-baseline <study-name> [--composite <name>] [--steps N] [--no-refresh-viz]`

Run a baseline composite. POST `/api/study-run-baseline`:

```json
{"study": "<study-name>", "composite": "<baseline-entry-name>", "steps": 5}
```

`composite` is the entry name in `baseline[]`. If omitted, defaults to `baseline[0]`.

**Detached run.** This endpoint returns `202 {"run_id": "...", "status": "running"}` — the run executes in the background. **Poll** `GET /api/composite-run/<run_id>/status` until `status` is `completed` (or `failed`) before treating the run as done, recording it as `ran`, or reading its outcomes. A `202` is *running*, not *ran* — recording a verdict off it violates the evidence-before-verdict gate in SKILL.md. (The `run_detached` helper in the implementation outline does this polling.)

On completion, charts refresh against the new run; pass `--no-refresh-viz` to skip.

#### `run-variant <study-name> --variant <n> [--steps N] [--no-refresh-viz]`

Run a variant. The server resolves the variant's `base_composite` against the Study's baseline list and layers `parameter_overrides` on top. POST `/api/study-run-variant`:

```json
{"study": "<study-name>", "variant": "<n>", "steps": 5}
```

**Detached run** (same as `run-baseline`): returns `202 {run_id, status:"running"}`. Poll `GET /api/composite-run/<run_id>/status` to `completed` before treating it as `ran` or recording outcomes. On completion, charts refresh against the new run; pass `--no-refresh-viz` to skip.

#### `run-script <study-name> [--entry <name>] [--list] [--no-refresh-viz]`

Run a study's **bespoke runner script** declared in `study.yaml.canonical_runs[]`. This is the third sibling alongside `run-baseline` / `run-variant`, and serves studies whose runners predate the dashboard's in-process composite executor — division-spanning multi-gen sims, calibration harnesses, parquet rerun wrappers (the v2ecoli `sims/run_dnaa_*.py` family is the canonical example). See `canonical_runs:` in [`docs/concepts/vivarium-workbench-model.md`](../../docs/concepts/vivarium-workbench-model.md#canonical-run-recipe-bespoke-scripts) for the schema.

Flow:

1. Locate `studies/<slug>/study.yaml` from the workspace root.
2. Read `canonical_runs:`. Fail with a clear message if absent or empty: *"Study <slug> has no `canonical_runs:` block. Either add one (see docs/concepts/vivarium-workbench-model.md#canonical-run-recipe-bespoke-scripts) or use `/viva-study run-baseline` if the study has a baseline composite."*
3. `--list`: print each entry as `<name> (default? ★) — <label or "—"> — python <script> <args...>`, exit 0.
4. Else: pick the entry whose `default: true` is set; if none flagged, pick the first. `--entry <name>` overrides.
5. Resolve `script:` against the workspace root. Fail if file doesn't exist.
6. Shell `python <script> <stringified-args...>` from the workspace root, streaming stdout/stderr through. Return the subprocess exit code.

```bash
# Run the default entry
/viva-study run-script dnaa-01-expression-dynamics

# Pick a named entry
/viva-study run-script dnaa-01-expression-dynamics --entry long

# Inspect what's declared without running
/viva-study run-script dnaa-01-expression-dynamics --list
```

This is a pure shell-out — no dashboard endpoint involved. The script is expected to own its own composite construction and emitter wiring (and to call `flush_parquet(composite)` itself if it uses the parquet emitter; the context manager can't enforce flush — see v2ecoli friction note 2026-05-27 #3). Future work: a `canonical_runs:` entry could declare its emitter so a wrapper handles flush, but for now the contract is "the script does everything."

After the script exits with code 0, automatically invokes `refresh-viz` for the study so registered charts regenerate against the new run. Pass `--no-refresh-viz` to skip.

- After a successful run (exit 0), also `POST /api/study-sync-runs {study: <slug>}`
  to record the run into study.yaml's runs[] (mechanical fields; authored
  outcomes are preserved). Skip with --no-sync-runs.
      curl -sf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"study": "<slug>"}' "$URL/api/study-sync-runs" | python3 -m json.tool

> **When NOT to use run-script.** If the study's runner can be expressed as a composite plus `parameter_overrides`, prefer `run-baseline` / `run-variant` — those go through the dashboard, surface the run in `runs.db`, and integrate with the auto-renderer. `run-script` is for runners that genuinely can't fit that mold (multi-gen division, external orchestration, custom emitter pipelines).

> **Gap — declarative sweeps not yet runnable.** The `study.yaml` schema

> `kind: sweep`, `axes`, `seeds`, `metrics`, `candidate_selection`, and

#### `refresh-viz <study-name> [--no-auto]`

Re-render the study's `visualizations[]` charts against the **latest run** so figures never silently go stale. This is the Simulate/Evaluate companion to `preview-viz` (which checks render wiring before a run); `refresh-viz` re-stamps charts with real run output after one.

**Purpose:** resolve the latest run from the study's `runs.db`, invoke each visualization entry's declared `render:` command with the run's emitter store wired in, and stamp a `<chart>.meta.json` sidecar so freshness is auditable.

**Mechanism:** `POST /api/study-refresh-viz/<slug>` — the workbench resolves the
study's latest run, re-renders each `visualizations[]` entry against it, and
stamps the `<chart>.meta.json` sidecars server-side.

```bash
curl -sf -X POST "$URL/api/study-refresh-viz/<slug>" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Output:** the endpoint returns `results`, a list of per-chart result dicts, each with `{name, chart, status}` where `status` is one of:

- `rendered` — the render command ran successfully and the chart + sidecar were restamped.
- `error` — the render command failed; the old chart is kept in place and the error is surfaced.
- `needs_manual_refresh` — the entry has no `render:` command declared, or an on-disk chart exists but isn't registered in `visualizations[]` (untracked).

**Arguments:**

- `<study-name>` (required) — study slug under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--no-auto` (optional) — reserved; at present `refresh-viz` always runs all entries. Pass to suppress the auto-refresh that `run-baseline` / `run-variant` / `run-script` invoke after a successful run.

**Notes:**

- If `runs.db` is absent or empty (no runs yet), `refresh-viz` exits with a clear message: "No runs recorded for `<slug>` — run a baseline or variant first."
- Repeated invocations are idempotent — each chart is overwritten in place, sidecar updated.
- The `--no-auto` flag corresponds to `--no-refresh-viz` on `run-baseline` / `run-variant` / `run-script`.

#### `visualizations[].render` convention

Each entry in `study.yaml.visualizations[]` may declare a `render:` command string — a shell command executed with `cwd` set to the study directory. The placeholder `{chart}` in the command is substituted with the entry's `chart:` path (relative to the study dir). The runner exposes the latest run to the command via two environment variables:

- `PBG_RUN_DIR` — absolute path to the run's emitter store (the zarr/parquet/SQLite directory).
- `PBG_RUN_ID` — the run's UUID from `runs_meta`.

At render time a `<chart>.meta.json` sidecar is stamped alongside each chart with:

```json
{
  "source_run_id": "<uuid>",
  "generation_id": "<generation-counter>",
  "rendered_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "command": "<the render command string, after substitution>",
  "content_hash": "<sha256 of the chart file>"
}
```

A chart is **fresh** when its `source_run_id` matches the study's latest run id; **stale** when it doesn't; **untracked** when an on-disk chart file has no corresponding `visualizations[]` entry; **unrendered** when a `visualizations[]` entry has no on-disk chart yet.

Example `visualizations[]` entry with a `render:` command:

```yaml
visualizations:
  - name: dnaa3_binding_analysis
    chart: charts/dnaa3_binding_analysis.svg
    render: "python scripts/render_dnaa3_binding_analysis.py --out {chart}"
```

When `render:` is absent the entry is still valid (the chart can be produced by other means) but `refresh-viz` will report it as `needs_manual_refresh`.

#### `clean <study-name> [--dry-run] [--include-out-paths]`

Wipe conventional simulator output for a study so a `from scratch` rerun starts clean. Closes friction note 2026-05-27 #4 ("rerun from scratch had no single command — the agent had to know all the per-study side-effects to wipe by hand").

**What gets removed** (only when actually present on disk):

- `studies/<slug>/runs.db` and its WAL/SHM siblings (`-wal`, `-shm`).
- `studies/<slug>/parquet-runs/` (the entire hive-partitioned tree).
- With `--include-out-paths`: every `args[-1]` from each `canonical_runs:` entry that ends in `.json` (the runner's `out_path` summary JSON). Off by default — those JSONs are sometimes hand-edited / version-controlled, so opt-in.

**What's never touched** (regardless of flags):

- Git-tracked files. Each candidate path is checked against `git ls-files --error-unmatch` before deletion; matches are skipped + reported as `skipped (tracked): <path>`. This prevents `clean` from blowing away an output file that's been committed.
- `studies/<slug>/study.yaml` itself.
- `studies/<slug>/sims/` (the runner scripts).
- `studies/<slug>/tests/` (the pytest suite).
- `studies/<slug>/viz/` (visualization scripts).
- `studies/<slug>/notes/` or `studies/<slug>/references/` (per CLAUDE.md cleanup-PR rule — these are field records that feed the next iteration of the spec).

**Flow:**

1. Common prelude (find `workspace.yaml`).
2. Resolve `studies/<slug>/` from the workspace root. Fail if absent.
3. Build the candidate list:
   - `runs.db`, `runs.db-wal`, `runs.db-shm` (each if exists)
   - `parquet-runs/` (if exists as dir)
   - With `--include-out-paths`: read `canonical_runs:` from `study.yaml`; for each entry, take the last positional arg from `args:`; if it ends in `.json` and resolves to a path under `studies/<slug>/`, add it.
4. For each candidate, run `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` (in the workspace root). On exit 0, the path is tracked — print `skipped (tracked): <path>` and skip.
5. If `--dry-run`: print each `would remove: <path>` and exit 0.
6. Otherwise remove each candidate (`rm -f` for files, `rm -rf` for `parquet-runs/`) and print `removed: <path>` per item.
7. Final summary: `cleaned <K> path(s) (S skipped, T tracked)` and the path of any next-recommended action (`/viva-study run-baseline <slug>` or `/viva-study run-script <slug>` depending on whether `canonical_runs:` is present).

```bash
# Preview without removing
/viva-study clean dnaa-01-expression-dynamics --dry-run

# Wipe runtime state (runs.db + parquet-runs/)
/viva-study clean dnaa-01-expression-dynamics

# Also wipe canonical_runs out_path JSON summaries
/viva-study clean dnaa-01-expression-dynamics --include-out-paths
```

> **Why not a dashboard endpoint?** `clean` operates entirely on local files (no dashboard state besides `runs.db`, which the dashboard reads opportunistically). Doing this via the dashboard would mean serializing file paths over HTTP for no benefit. The skill shells `rm` directly.

> **Investigation-level fan-out.** `/viva-investigation run` doesn't yet have a companion `clean` — call `/viva-study clean` per-member if you want a full investigation wipe. If this becomes routine, lift a `/viva-investigation clean <slug> [--studies a,b]` analogous to the run orchestrator.

### Evaluate subcommands

No `pbg-study` subcommands run here directly. Evaluation is driven by:

- `POST /api/study-tests-run {study}` — run the study's pytest suite (Tests tab in the dashboard); results land in `study.yaml.tests.last_results`.
- `/viva-viz` — add or render visualizations (Visualizations tab).

### Decide subcommands

#### `set-conclusion <study-name> '<markdown>'`

Replace the Study's conclusion. POST `/api/study-set-conclusion`:

```json
{"study": "<study-name>", "text": "<markdown>"}
```

The markdown is canonically structured under H2 headers: `## Claims`, `## Evidence`, `## Limitations`, `## Next steps`.

#### `set-verdicts <slug> [--regression PASS|FAIL|MIXED|PENDING] [--basis-regression '<text>'] [--biological PASS|FAIL|MIXED|PENDING] [--basis-biological '<text>'] [--explanatory POSITIVE|NEUTRAL|NEGATIVE|PENDING] [--basis-explanatory '<text>'] [--dry-run]`

Write the v4 three-track `conclusion_verdicts` block on `studies/<slug>/study.yaml`. Distinct from `set-conclusion` (which writes the markdown conclusion blob): `set-verdicts` writes structured `{result, basis}` pairs across three orthogonal axes.

**The three tracks:**

- `regression_compatibility` — does the code still build/run cleanly? `result` is `PASS | FAIL | MIXED | PENDING`.
- `biological_validation` — does the model match the literature? `result` is `PASS | FAIL | MIXED | PENDING`.
- `explanatory_gain` — did we learn something new? `result` is `POSITIVE | NEUTRAL | NEGATIVE | PENDING`.

Lets a study be "PASS on regression but MIXED on biology" instead of being forced into one boolean. Each track's `result` and `basis` can be set independently; passing only `--biological` updates that track and leaves the others alone. Existing tracks merge — passing `--biological PASS` without `--basis-biological` keeps the previous basis text.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`.
- `--regression <result>` / `--basis-regression '<text>'` — update the regression track. Either flag alone is enough to update that field.
- `--biological <result>` / `--basis-biological '<text>'` — update the biological track.
- `--explanatory <result>` / `--basis-explanatory '<text>'` — update the explanatory track.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff; do not write.

At least one flag is required. YAML-direct subcommand.

**Example.** Recording dnaa-02's verdicts after the simulation runs:

```bash
/viva-study set-verdicts dnaa-02-atp-hydrolysis \
  --regression PASS --basis-regression "2026-05-17 implementation builds cleanly." \
  --biological MIXED --basis-biological "atp_fraction = 0.997, outside band [0.2, 0.5]." \
  --explanatory POSITIVE --basis-explanatory "Three findings worth keeping."
```

#### `findings <study-slug> [--auto] [--dry-run]`

Walk the study's `behavior_tests[]` outcomes (under `runs[]`) and propose
one structured finding per outcome not already covered by an entry in
`findings[]`. The Pass 10A findings protocol (see
[`vivarium-workbench-model.md`](../../docs/concepts/vivarium-workbench-model.md#findings-protocol-pass-10a))
formalizes each finding as `{id, kind, status, statement}` plus optional
`evidence` / `expected` / `expert_reference` / `explanation` / `next_action`
sub-objects.

**Arguments:**

- `<study-slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`. Abort if `study.yaml` is missing.
- `--auto` (optional) — skip the interactive curation loop; write the heuristic drafts as-is. Useful for an LLM agent that has already decided what to write.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed `findings[]` additions as a YAML diff; do not write.

**Behavior (steps Claude follows when running this subcommand):**

1. **Resolve study.** Read `studies/<slug>/study.yaml`. Abort if absent: "Study '<slug>' not found. Run `/viva-study new` to create it."
2. **Extract outcomes.** Walk `runs[].outcomes[]` (or `runs[].test_results[]` for the flat form). For each `behavior_tests[]` outcome not already covered by a finding (match on existing `findings[].evidence.from_test`), produce a draft via the heuristic:
   - PASS → `kind: biological`, `status: confirms`, statement = "v2ecoli reproduces `<test-description>` within tolerance".
   - FAIL → ask the user: biological (`contradicts`) vs computational (`novel`). If `--auto`, default to biological/contradicts.
3. **Auto-assign `id`.** Use the next free `F-NN` (skipping any used by existing findings).
4. **Pre-fill from heuristics.** `evidence.from_run` + `evidence.from_test` + (when present) `evidence.observed`; `expected.summary` from the test's `expected_summary` or `calibration_anchor.literature_summary` when set.
5. **Surface candidate quotes.** `POST /api/study-findings` runs the expert-PDF search server-side (keywords from each test name + description) and folds candidate quotes into the drafted findings. To search interactively for a specific finding, call `GET /api/expert-search?q=<term1,term2>&max_hits=3` and offer the top hits (doc, page, snippet) as candidate `expert_reference.quote` + `expected.cites` entries.
6. **Interactive curation (default, skipped when `--auto`).** For each draft, ask the user to fill / refine: `statement`, `expected.summary`, `expected.cites` (bib_keys), `expert_reference` (doc + quote + note), `next_action`. The user can reject the draft outright.
7. **Append to `study.yaml.findings[]`.** Atomic write: serialize updated YAML to `study.yaml.tmp`, then `os.replace()` over the original. Preserve all other top-level keys verbatim.
8. **Bibliography crosscheck (warn).** After the walk, compare every `expected.cites` entry against `references/papers.bib` keys; print a warning for any unknown bib_key so the user can decide whether to add it.
9. **Report.** Print a one-line summary: appended count, skipped (already-covered) count, unknown bib_keys count.

**Implementation note:** the deterministic draft-walk lives server-side in
[`viva_superpowers/study_findings.py`](../../viva_superpowers/study_findings.py),
invoked via `POST /api/study-findings {study, auto?, dry_run?}`. The endpoint
handles workspace discovery, draft heuristics, expert-PDF search, atomic-write,
and the bib-key crosscheck, returning a `{proposed, appended, skipped_existing,
cited_bib_keys, unknown_bib_keys, wrote}` summary. The interactive step (6) is
performed by the host Claude instance following the prose flow above.

#### `propose-followup <parent-slug> --id <id> --title '<t>' --motivation '<m>' [--mechanism '<hyp>'] [--seed-from-file <path>] [--dry-run]`

Append one entry to `studies/<parent-slug>/study.yaml.followup_proposals[]` (creates the list if absent). This is the Decide-phase "we should also study X" capture. The proposal is later lifted into a sibling study via `seed-from-followup`.

**Arguments:**

- `<parent-slug>` (required) — existing study under `studies/<parent-slug>/`. Abort if `study.yaml` is missing.
- `--id <id>` (required) — slug matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`. Must be unique within the parent's `followup_proposals[]`. 409-style error if duplicate.
- `--title '<t>'` (required) — short human-readable title.
- `--motivation '<m>'` (required) — what gap from this study motivates the follow-up.
- `--mechanism '<hyp>'` (optional) — hypothesized missing biology/process. Stored as `hypothesized_mechanism`. Falls through to the seeded child's `model_change:` if no explicit `seed.model_change` is provided at seed time.
- `--seed-from-file <path>` (optional) — YAML file whose contents are loaded as the `seed:` block of the proposal. Free-form; common keys are `purpose`, `key_assumptions`, `model_change`, `simulation_set`, `pipeline_gate`.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed diff and stop.

**Behavior (steps Claude follows):**

1. **Resolve study.** Read `studies/<parent-slug>/study.yaml`. If absent, abort.
2. **Check id uniqueness.** Walk `followup_proposals[]` (treat absent as empty list). If any entry has `id == --id`, abort: "Proposal '<id>' already exists on study '<parent-slug>'."
3. **Build the proposal dict.** Defaults: `status: proposed`. Include only the keys provided on the CLI; `seed:` comes from `--seed-from-file` (parsed as YAML; abort on parse error).
4. **Preview.** Print a unified diff of `followup_proposals` before/after.
5. **Confirm.** `yes` → write; `no` → abort. Skip step 6 if `--dry-run`.
6. **Atomic write.** Serialize the updated study.yaml to `studies/<parent-slug>/study.yaml.tmp`, then `mv` over the original. Preserve all other top-level keys verbatim.
7. **Report.** Print one line: `Added proposal <id> to <parent-slug>.followup_proposals (now N entries).`

#### `seed-from-followup <parent-slug> <proposal-id> [--new-slug <slug>] [--from-finding <finding-id>] [--dry-run]`

Lift a parent's `followup_proposals[id == <proposal-id>]` entry into a brand-new sibling study, stamped with `seeded_from:` and auto-linked back to the parent via `pipeline_gate.prerequisites`.

**Arguments:**

- `<parent-slug>` (required) — existing parent study.
- `<proposal-id>` (required) — id of the proposal entry to seed from. Status must be `proposed` or `accepted`; abort on `seeded` (already seeded) or `rejected`.
- `--new-slug <slug>` (optional) — slug for the new study. Default: the proposal's `id`. Abort if `studies/<new-slug>/` already exists.
- `--from-finding <finding-id>` (optional, **Pass 10B**) — id of a finding (e.g. `F-03`) on the parent's `findings[]`. When passed, pre-populates the child from that finding: `purpose:` / `key_assumptions:` from `explanation` + `next_action` + `evidence.smoking_gun`; `seeded_from.evidence` from the finding's `evidence` block; `pipeline_gate.proceed_condition` from `next_action`; `behavior_tests` carries over the parent test referenced by `evidence.from_test` (reclassified as `primary`); `model_change.notes` is stamped with a TBD pointer when `explanation` is set. The child is also stamped with `seeded_from.finding: <id>`, and the parent's proposal entry records `linked_finding: <id>` so the lineage finding → proposal → child study is queryable. Abort if the finding id isn't on the parent.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print both proposed diffs and stop.

**Behavior (steps Claude follows):**

The whole seed — resolving the proposal (or finding, Pass 10B), building the
child `study.yaml` with the `purpose` / `key_assumptions` / `seeded_from` /
`pipeline_gate` / `behavior_tests` / `model_change` skeleton and the finding→child
merge, flipping the parent proposal to `status: seeded` + `linked_finding`, and
the atomic writes — is done **server-side** by `POST /api/study-seed-followup`.
The skill drives it:

1. **Resolve parent + proposal.** Read `studies/<parent-slug>/study.yaml`, find `followup_proposals[id == <proposal-id>]`. Abort if missing or if `status not in {proposed, accepted}`. (This is a read for the confirm preview; the endpoint re-validates.)
2. **Confirm with the user** what will be seeded (proposal title/motivation; the `--from-finding` id when passed). On `no`, abort.
3. **Seed via the endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"parent": "<parent-slug>", "proposal_id": "<proposal-id>"}' \
     "$URL/api/study-seed-followup" | python3 -m json.tool
   ```
   For **Pass 10B** (seed from a specific finding), send `finding_id` instead of / alongside `proposal_id` — `finding_id` wins:
   ```bash
   curl -sf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"parent": "<parent-slug>", "proposal_id": "<proposal-id>", "finding_id": "<finding-id>"}' \
     "$URL/api/study-seed-followup" | python3 -m json.tool
   ```
   The endpoint routes through the unified followup field families (finding wins), does the finding→child merge (purpose/key_assumptions/seeded_from.evidence/pipeline_gate.proceed_condition/behavior_tests carry-over/model_change), writes the child + flips the parent proposal, and returns `{new_study_name, new_slug}`. 404 → parent not found; 400 → bad args.
4. **Report.** Print: `Seeded <new_slug> from <parent-slug>.followup_proposals[<proposal-id>]. Parent proposal marked seeded.` Append `Linked finding: <finding-id>.` when `--from-finding` was passed.

> **Endpoint limitations (server derives the slug).** `POST /api/study-seed-followup` derives `new_slug` from the proposal id server-side and writes immediately, so `--new-slug` and `--dry-run` are **not yet honored** by this path (tracked as a follow-up endpoint enhancement). To preview without writing, inspect the proposal's `seed:` block first; to rename, rename the created study dir afterward.

**Notes:**

- Thin client → `POST /api/study-seed-followup` (the seed is computed + written server-side; `seed_from_followup` lives in the plugin backing the endpoint).
- After seeding, the child appears in the dashboard's Studies tab on the next workspace refresh; the parent's proposal entry's `seeded_study:` makes the lineage visible in the Decide panel.

#### `feedback-respond <slug> [--apply] [--dry-run]`

Turn **open expert feedback** into tracked, applied actions — the closing half
of the reflexive loop (SP3b). Imported feedback (via `viva-feedback-import`)
dead-ends at a free-text status today; this subcommand maps each open feedback
item to a concrete action and persists it as a tracked artifact in the feedback
yaml's `actions:` block (parallel to `responses:`), keyed by a deterministic
`feedback_item_id`. This is the persisted form of the "map each point to an
action" step in [`docs/conventions/handling-investigation-feedback.md`](../../docs/conventions/handling-investigation-feedback.md).

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** `superpowers:receiving-code-review` — expert feedback
on a study is code review for the model, so treat it with the same rigor: verify
before you act. Concretely, before recording a `next_action` (or any action)
that references a numeric claim, check it against `computed_outcomes` in
`study.yaml` rather than taking the expert's framing on faith. If the requested
band contradicts the run data, respond with the chart and push back — never
silently re-fit the model to agree just to close the item (this is the same
discipline as the PROVIDED-MECHANISMS-ONLY house rule: don't fabricate a fix to
force a match).

**AI-free split.** The *aggregation* (open-item read), the *recording*
(`POST /api/feedback-record-action`), and the *apply*
(`POST /api/feedback-apply-action`) are deterministic and computed server-side —
the primitives live in
[`viva_superpowers/feedback_actions.py`](../../viva_superpowers/feedback_actions.py)
backing those endpoints. The **judgment** — which action `kind` best addresses a
feedback item and what its `proposed_text` should be — is the agent's, performed
here in the skill. The skill never silently mutates design: it proposes +
records, and applies only the explicit target of an action.

**Arguments:**

- `<slug>` (required) — study under `studies/<slug>/`. Abort if `study.yaml` is missing.
- `--apply` (optional) — after recording each action, immediately `POST /api/feedback-apply-action {item_id}` for it. Without `--apply`, the actions are recorded as `open` and left for the user (or the dashboard's Apply button) to apply.
- `--dry-run` (optional) — print the proposed `kind` + `proposed_text` per open item; record nothing.

**The four action kinds (the agent picks one per item):**

- `next_action` — the feedback points at a finding that should drive follow-up. The agent picks the `target_finding` (an `F-NN` id in `study.yaml.findings[]`) and writes the imperative `proposed_text`; applying it sets `findings[<target_finding>].next_action = proposed_text`. **This is the SP3a join** — a finding with a `next_action` is then seedable into a child study via `seed-from-followup --from-finding`.
- `finding` — the feedback surfaces a result worth recording as its own finding; applying drafts a finding stub (`status: draft`, `from_feedback: <item_id>`) in the target study.
- `design-edit` — the feedback proposes a model/design change; applying records a tracked note only (NO silent design mutation — the human makes the edit).
- `study-seed` — the feedback calls for a whole new study; applying seeds a child via SP3a's `resolve_seed_source` + `write_child_study`.

**Behavior (steps the host Claude follows):**

1. **Read open items.** `GET /api/study/<slug>` and take the feedback actions with `status == "open"` (no action recorded yet — the study-detail payload surfaces them). If none, report "No open feedback items for `<slug>`." and stop.
2. **Propose per item (the judgment).** For each open item, read the feedback `text` and the study's `findings[]` and decide the best `kind` + `proposed_text` (+ `target_finding` for `next_action`, or seed selectors for `study-seed`). Show the proposal. Under `--dry-run`, stop after printing.
3. **Record.** `POST /api/feedback-record-action {item_id, kind, target_study: <slug>, proposed_text, target_finding?}` to write the `actions[item_id]` entry (status `open`) into the feedback yaml (comment-preserving ruamel write, server-side).
4. **Optionally apply.** When `--apply` is passed, `POST /api/feedback-apply-action {item_id}` per recorded action. For a `next_action` action this writes `findings[<target_finding>].next_action`; the action flips to `applied` (by/at). Apply is idempotent (re-apply → `already_applied`).
5. **Report.** Print per item: `item_id`, chosen `kind`, `proposed_text`, and `recorded` / `applied`. Note any that need a human design-edit.

**Notes:**

- The `actions:` block is a NEW top-level key in the feedback yaml, parallel to `responses:`, keyed by `feedback_item_id(section, ts, author)`. Writes are idempotent + comment-preserving.
- The dashboard's study-detail feedback panel renders these tracked actions (open/applied badge) and offers an **Apply** button that POSTs `item_id` to `/api/feedback-apply-action` → `apply_feedback_action` — so the same primitive backs both the skill and the UI.

### Utility

#### `open <study-name>`

Open the Study's detail page in the user's default browser. POST `/api/open-window`:

```json
{"route": "/studies/<name>"}
```
